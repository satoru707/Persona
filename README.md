## Note
This was my first project using TypeScript and one of my earliest coding experiences. At the time, I was still figuring out how to structure code — so functions ended up scattered across multiple files and the organization wasn’t the cleanest. I later did a light cleanup just because I was bored, so while it may still look messy now, trust me, it was **much worse** before.

The project is open for further cleanup and refactoring, especially now that I’ve learned better coding practices.
